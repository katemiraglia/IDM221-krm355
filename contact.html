      Hi, Iâ€™m Kate, a graphic designer and creative based in Philadelphia, PA. I
      am currently in my final year of undergrad at Drexel University pursuing a
      Bachelors of Science in Graphic Design with a minor in User Experience and
      Interaction Design. I have always had a passion for all things creative
      from arts and crafts to fine arts and realism to all aspects of design.
      Design has given me the ability to express my creativity through my work
      daily, and I have a wide range of design interests, including but not
      limited to web design, publication design, environmental graphic design,
      and branding.
